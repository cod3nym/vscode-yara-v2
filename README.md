### Snippets
This extension provides some text snippets, which allows users to auto-complete certain common YARA rule patterns.

More information can be found on the [Snippets wiki page](https://github.com/infosec-intern/vscode-yara/wiki/Snippets).

## Problems?
If you encounter an issue with the syntax, feel free to create an issue or pull request!
Alternatively, check out some of the YARA syntaxes for Sublime and Atom, or the one bundled with YARA itself.
They use the same syntax engine as VSCode and should work the same way.
